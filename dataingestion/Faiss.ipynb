India is a land of great diversity, rich history, and remarkable achievements. From ancient times to the modern era, India has played an important role in shaping the world in fields like science, mathematics, philosophy, and culture. It is the seventh-largest country in the world by area and the most populous country, with over 1.4 billion people. India is home to a variety of languages, religions, traditions, and festivals, making it one of the most unique countries in the world.'),\n",

The Mughals built beautiful monuments like the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, and Fatehpur Sikri. Leaders such as Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb made a lasting impact on Indian culture. However, India also faced colonial rule for nearly 200 years, from 1757 to 1947, when the British controlled the country. India’s economy was drained, and its people suffered under British policies. The struggle for freedom, led by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Bhagat Singh, finally led to India’s independence on August 15, 1947.'),\n",

The Gupta Empire is often called the “Golden Age of India” because of the major achievements in fields like science, mathematics, astronomy, and art.

This was one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations, where cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had advanced drainage systems, well-planned streets, and organized houses. The people of this civilization were skilled in farming, trade, and craftsmanship. Following this, the Vedic Period, around 1500 to 600 BCE, marked the creation of the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. This was also when ideas like yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda emerged. During this time, education and philosophy played an important role in society.')]"
